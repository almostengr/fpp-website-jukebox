# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)

## Why not use Remote Falcon? This plugin seems to have the same functionality.

True this plugin does have similar functionality as Remote Falcon. The reason that this plugin was created,
is to get around some of the issues that have been observed with Remote Falcon. Those issues include, but 
are not limited to, unexpected downtime during high demand, website that does not easily integrate with 
existing websites, and being able to use different codes for different days.
